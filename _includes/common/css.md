You already know how to [write a HTML page](../html/) and also how to
[use the Latte templating system](../templates/).
Still you do not know, how to make your page **not** to look like it came from 1995.
The answer is CSS -- a special syntax (yes, another language) which can define how
HTML elements are [rendered](/articles/css/) in your browser.

In this article I will not teach you every detail of CSS, but I want to show you some basics.
Usually a beautiful design does not come from a programmer or HTML coder but from professional
graphician. To make a great design you need a talent and much experience with graphical design.
That is something that most programmers do not have (and that is OK, because we have talent to write
a good code). Nevertheless you need to know how to apply some CSS styles to make your application look modern.

## CSS Basics
[CSS is a language](/articles/css/#cascading-style-sheets) for the definition of graphical properties for individual HTML elements -- things like text color, text size, background color, position, etc.
Each browser has a set of default CSS definitions for
HTML elements (called *user agent stylesheet*), we can override these definitions by using our own.

Basically a CSS file looks like this:

{% highlight css %}
body {
    font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 12pt;
}
h1 {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It contains a set of [**CSS selectors**](/articles/css/#selectors) (`body` or `h1` in this case) each of them containing a
set of **CSS properties** with
values in curly braces divided by semicolons. Most CSS properties and their values are self-explaining
and as you can see, these properties are also very specific. For example, you can set a different
color and style for each side of an element:

{% highlight css %}
input {
    border-left-width: 3px;
    border-left-style: dotted;
    border-left-color: #FF0000;

    /* more compact syntax */
    border-bottom: 3px dashed #00FF00;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This code should produce something like this (an input with different border styles and colors):

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Applied CSS](/common/css/example-01.png)

{: .note}
`/* more compact syntax */` is a CSS [multi-line comment](/articles/programming/#comment).
There are no single-line comments in CSS.

You will soon notice, that a CSS file grows fast for complicated designs. The advantage of CSS is that you can define
CSS styles for many HTML elements globally using those CSS selectors [(read on)](#css-selectors).

The styles which you define for elements in the upper levels of the HTML structure are inherited by their
descendants, unless these elements are told to be different. In case of conflict (you can set different
values of the same attribute for an element), the right CSS definition is selected by
[*cascading*](/articles/css/#cascading) of
styles. In short the cascading means that more specific selectors and definitions which are defined
last are used in case of uncertainty. You can observe these conflicts using the DOM inspector in
[developer tools](/course/not-a-student/#web-browser) (F12) of your browser:

![Screenshot -- Cascading](/common/css/cascading.png)

{: .note}
Strikeout property values are those which are *overridden*.

### Linking your CSS to HTML file
To link the style definition to our page, we need to pass our CSS definitions into the browser.
There are [three ways how to do it](/articles/css/#connecting-styles-with-html), but the best is to
place the CSS definitions into a
separate file(s). This way, you can easily swap CSS files if you want to apply a new design.
Notice in the [developer console (F12)](/course/not-a-student/#web-browser) that after you link the HTML and CSS file together, a new
[HTTP request](/articles/http/) is sent by the browser to retrieve that CSS file.

{% highlight html %}
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="link/to/your/css/file.css">
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

### CSS Selectors
A selector is a powerful expression which can locate HTML elements in your page. Remind yourself that
[HTML is a tree-like](/articles/html/#hierarchical-structure) structure:

{: .image-popup}
![HTML tree](/common/css/html.svg)

In such a structure you can describe location of an element by saying that it has a certain sequence of parents, e.g.:
you can select the `<a>` element in the `<footer>` part of the page by typing the CSS selector `footer p a`. The spaces
between element names represent nesting deeper in the tree structure. You can also write just `footer a`, because
there is no other `<a>` element in the `<footer>` tag (other than the one in `p`) so there is no need to be so specific.
Selectors do not need to
list every level of the HTML structure when using spaces. The most basic and most general CSS selector is just the
name of a HTML element.

In some cases you might want to emphasize the parent-child relationship with `>` operator. That means that the element behind
this operator is a **direct descendant** of the element before the `>` operator. With the `>` operator you need to
write `footer>p>a` because `footer>a` would not work (the element `a` is not a direct descendant of `footer`).

#### Class selector
The CSS selectors in the paragraphs above are still very general. Sometimes you have multiple HTML elements, say those `<li>`
elements, and you want two of them to look different than the others. You can achieve this by using *classes*. A class
is just an identifier which you (or a HTML coder) fabricate and put in the `class` attribute of the desired element:

{% highlight css %}
li {
    list-style-type: disc;
}
li.different-than-others {
    list-style-type: square;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<ul>
    <li><a href="...">...</a></li>
    <li><a href="...">...</a></li>
    <li class="different-than-others"><a href="...">...</a></li>
    <li class="different-than-others"><a href="...">...</a></li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that there is a difference between `li.different-than-others` and `li .different-than-others`. The first
one selects a `<li>` element with the class `different-than-others` and the latter selects **any** element
with the class `different-than-others` within a `<li>` element.

#### ID selector
Sometimes you may wish to be even more specific and select one particular HTML element. That element is
provided with an `id` attribute, which has to have a unique value among all other `id` attributes on the page.
In the CSS selector you simply use `#` with the `id` attribute value similarly to a class `.` selector:

{% highlight css %}
#special {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
{% endhighlight css %}

{% highlight html %}
<h1 id="special">This H1 is unique</h1>
{% endhighlight html %}

#### Attribute selectors
You can also select elements just by knowing certain HTML attribute values or their presence
on HTML elements. This is useful especially with forms because otherwise you have to pollute your HTML code
with unnecessary `class` attributes:

{% highlight css %}
input[type=checkbox] {
    /* some CSS just for checkboxes */
}
input[required] {
    /* some CSS just for mandatory inputs */
}
{% endhighlight css %}

#### Pseudo-classes
A [pseudo-class](/articles/css/#pseudo-classes) is a special selector for features which cannot be easily recorded in the HTML code or
described with classes. Most popular one is `:hover` which is used to style
HTML elements while a mouse cursor is present over them (an interesting point is that some modern devices
do not have a mouse). You can use pseudo-classes also on parent elements:

{% highlight css %}
/* applied for all a's in lists */
ul li a {
    text-decoration: none;
}
/* applied on all a's when mouse is over whole ul */
ul:hover li a {
    color: #FF0000;
}
/* applied when mouse is over particular a */
ul li a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
{% endhighlight css %}

Some useful [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes):

- `:visited` -- visited link
- `:checked` -- checked input, same as `input[checked]`
- `:valid` -- valid input
- `:invalid` -- invalid input
- `:nth-child(even)` and `:nth-child(odd)` -- even and odd elements

#### Combining CSS selectors
More CSS selectors can be combined with commas:

{% highlight css %}
/* applied for all headers */
h1, h2, h3 {
}
/* applied for some form inputs */
textarea, input[type=text], input[type=number], select {
}
{% endhighlight css %}

#### Task
Try to write a CSS selector to find all `<a>` tags, which are direct descendants of a `<td>` element in
the HTML structure presented in the figure above. Add another CSS selector for the same elements only when mouse
cursor is over one of them.

{: .solution}
{% highlight css %}
table td>a {
    /* some CSS definitions */
}
table td>a:hover {
    /* some CSS definitions which apply only when mouse cursor is over that element */
}
{% endhighlight %}

### CSS properties
There are [too many CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) to list here,
you can find them [in a great Cheat sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) or using Google just by typing what
you want to achieve. As the HTML language evolves, CSS (currently in version 3) also expands the list of available properties.
You can check current support of the different web technologies among internet browsers on [http://caniuse.com/](http://caniuse.com/).

#### Task
Try to find and use CSS for rounded corners.

{: .solution}
{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/css/round-corners.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Colors
[Colors](/articles/css/#css-colors) are defined with their [RGB components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model).
Usually a HEX coding is used, but plain RGB is also available:

{% highlight css %}
h1 {
    color: #FF0000;
    /* or */
    color: rgb(255,0,0);
}
{% endhighlight css %}

The [HEX coding](/articles/css/#hexadecimal-colors) makes it simple to mix colors because it gives you 16 levels of
each basic color -- e.g. if you want to mix a somewhat yellowish color you can take 12 levels (C - 12) of red and
10 levels (A - 10) of green which is encoded like this <span style="color: #CCAA00">#CCAA00</span>.

You can even shorten that HEX color entry by leaving out the repeating letters/numbers `#CCAA00` -> `#CA0`.

### Unit system
There are many CSS units to set sizes of different elements, most used ones are *px*, *em*, *rem*, *pt* and *%*.
CSS units can be divided into *absolute units* (*mm*, *cm*, *in*, *pt*) and *relative units* (*%*, *em*, *rem*,
*vw*, *vh*, *vmin*, *vmax*, *ex*, *ch*). The calculation of element's size given by a relative unit is based on
the size or some other characteristics of its parent. Elements with their size in absolute units render with
the same size on any device.
The pixel unit *px* is somewhere between because the size of a pixel can vary with screen resolution or pixel density.

Some useful relative units:

-   *%* -- relative to parent size (for height, the parent must have defined absolute height,
    otherwise the calculations would cause an infinite loop -- height of the parent is based on the content height)
-   *em* -- size of parent font (you should set the `<body>` font in *pt* to have at least top level font size given)
-   *rem* -- size of root element (`<body>`) font
-   *vw*, *vh* -- percent of window width/height (v stands for viewport)
-   *vmin*, *vmax* -- percent of smaller/larger dimension of viewport

You can set width and height only for
[block elements](/articles/css/layout/#block-layout). [Inline elements](/articles/css/layout/#inline-layout)
can only change the size of font (line-height). To switch
this behavior, you can use the CSS property `display` with value `block` or `inline`. There is also a mode called
`inline-block` which enables inline elements to have specific width and height and not wrap lines at their ends.

### Positioning
There are four types of element's [position modes](/articles/css/layout/#positioned-layout). The default one
is *static* which places inline elements on
a single baseline as long as they fit width of the window and block elements on entire width of the window.
The position mode called [*Relative*](/articles/css/layout/#relative-position) is used to displace an
element from its default (*static*) position. But it is mostly
used just as a container for the [*Absolute*](/articles/css/layout/#absolute-position) position mode.
The *absolute* mode is used to place the element on a certain position
within its parent. The parent is either the `body` element or the element with its position set to anything other than *static*.
The [*fixed position*](/articles/css/layout/#fixed-position) is used to place the element on a given position in the browser
window (even scrolling does not affect
the element position -- navigation panels on some sites behave like this).

### Task
Try to set relative and absolute positions and different sizes for some box elements (`<div>`s):

-   Make a `<div>` with size 3 &times; 3 cm.
-   Place this `<div>` (using absolute positioning) into the bottom right corner of another one, which has 10cm height.
-   Explore the difference between absolute `<div>` inside a *relative* and a *static* parent element.
-   Make a `<div>` with the fixed position and place it in the bottom left corner. Make it 30% of the window size.

{: .solution}
{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/css/relative-absolute.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Box-model and size
In CSS, you can set a different size for outer offset (`margin`), inner offset (`padding`) and `border`.
By default the margin, border and padding are not included in the width and height of an element. Therefore
to calculate how much space an element will occupy on the screen you have to sum all of these values for the top, left,
bottom and right side of an element plus the element's width and height.

![Box model](/common/css/box-model.svg)

{: .note}
You can set different values for `padding`, `margin` and `border` at each side of the element. Remember that if
you want to save some time writing those long CSS property names, you can put all dimensions into one definition
in clock-wise order (top, right, bottom, left):

{% highlight css %}
.some-element-with-padding-and-margin {
           /* T    R    B    L */
    padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;
           /* top is 10px and rest is 20px */
    margin: 10px 20px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Summary
In this chapter you have learned about CSS and why and how to use it. This article covers the basics,
there is [much more to know](/articles/html/) if you want to be a professional HTML coder (a person who converts
graphical design into the HTML and CSS codes). The important thing is that you can understand the CSS syntax
and know how to connect CSS with HTML. You should be able to find basic CSS properties online and be able
to use them.

In the [following chapter](./bootstrap/) I will show you how to use some freely available CSS styles
so that you can save a lot of work designing a full page from scratch.

### New Concepts and Terms
- CSS
- CSS selector
- CSS properties
- CSS units
- CSS class
- CSS colors

### Control question
- Where to put CSS files (separate CSS file, `<style>` tag, inline)?
- Should you use element names in CSS selectors or just class names?
- Is pixel (px) an absolute unit?
