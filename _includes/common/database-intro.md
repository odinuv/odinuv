In previous chapters, you have learned how to create a static HTML page, then how to
add dynamic content generated in a PHP script to that page. Then you have learned how
to organize the PHP and HTML code using templates, so that it doesn't become a
complete mess.

So far it's probably still a bit boring, because the data that the application displays
is still somewhat hardcoded in the PHP script. We would like to make the application
interactive, so that a user can permanently store and retrieve some arbitrary data.
The answer to this is that we need a [database server](/articles/database-systems/).

In this walkthrough I will be using a [relational database](/articles/relational-database/), which means that
the data is organized into [tables](/articles/sql-join/#relation-vs-table). Specifically, I will be using
[PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/), which is again a rather arbitrary choice, because for
what we need, any relation database could be used.

## Getting started
Before you get started, you need a [database server](/course/not-a-student/#installing-your-own-server-on-your-pc) and credentials to it.
You also need an access to some kind of an administration interface, preferably
a graphical one, so that you don't get completely lost at the beginning.

To get you started as quickly as possible, I prepared a sample database for you.
It contains the structure of the [project](/course/#project-assignment) and also some sample data,
which is useful for testing your application. First you need to import the database,
then you can start playing with it using the
[SQL language](/articles/sql-join/).

### Import Database
I prepared files that you can import into the database, there are two files, the first one contains
the definition of what tables do exist in the database and the second one contains sample data.
Download both files (use 'Save Link As') and import both files using the procedure
outlined below.

- [Database Structure PostgreSQL](/common/pgsql-structure.sql)
- [Sample data PostgreSQL](/common/pgsql-data.sql)
- [Database Structure MySQL](/common/mysql-structure.sql)
- [Sample data MySQL](/common/mysql-data.sql)

To import the file using the [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) client. Click on **Import**, select the
file you have downloaded, and click **Execute**. Repeat the process for both files:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Import data](/common/database-intro/adminer-import-1.png)

Once you have the structure of the database and the data imported, you
should see, content in the Adminer:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Imported data](/common/database-intro/adminer-import-2.png)

### SQL Language
SQL is a language which is used for communicating with most of the widely used database servers.
If you have been following this Walkthrough from the [beginning](../html/), then this is
the fourth language you have learned so far (after HTML, PHP, Latte Macro Language).

The SQL language has only four everyday-use commands (there are dozens of others, which are
rarely used and you can always look them up):

- INSERT for inserting data into the database
- UPDATE for modifying data already in the database
- DELETE for removing data from the database
- SELECT for obtaining data from the database

The first three commands are really simple, as you will see in the following exercise.
The SELECT command is incredibly complicated and it usually takes years to learn all the
intricacies connected with it (so I'll start with some simple uses and leave the
more difficult ones until later).

The SQL language is a programming language, but instead of writing lengthy pieces of a programming
code as in PHP, we only write queries. An SQL query is a self-contained code piece -- **statement**
-- instructing the database server to do something (e.g. delete some data). The query may
contain other statements inside.

#### Database Schema
When working with a database, it is really important to know the structure of the database.
The following graphic is the database schema and it shows each table, the columns in the table and
their data types. It also shows relationships between the tables (which we won't use much in this
chapter). The design of a database structure is called **Database Schema**. Keep it handy.

{: .image-popup}
![Database schema](/common/schema.svg)

As we are working with a [relational database system](/articles/relational-database/), data is stored in tables.
Each table has **columns** (with some name and datatype -- as defined in the database schema)
and **rows** which contain the actual data. Most operations in SQL work on full rows -- sometimes
called **records**.

{: .note}
In SQL the [keywords](/articles/programming/#keywords) are usually written ALL CAPS, this
is just a convention to improve readability. It has no effect on the query itself. SQL statements
are delimited by the semicolon `;`. Because in most cases, only a single SQL statement is used, the
semicolon at the end of it may be safely omitted (it is a delimiter, not terminator).

#### Reading Database Structure
When you have the database schema imported into your own database, you should take time to
explore it in more detail. The database schema pictured above gives you only a general overview
of what structure is defined for the data. In fact the database schema defines all
[integrity constraints](/articles/database-systems/#data-integrity). Examine
the structure of the `person` table in your database:

{: .image-popup}
![Database structure](/common/database-intro/adminer-structure.png)

Here you can see for example that:

- the column `id_person` has the data type `integer`,
- the column `id_person` is an [automatically generated key](/articles/database-tech/#automatically-generated-key) (Auto Increment),
- the column `id_person` has the default value `nextval('person_id_person_seq')` (next value of a [sequence](/articles/database-tech/#automatically-generated-key)),
- the column `birth_day` has the data type `date`,
- the column `birth_day` allows inserting `NULL`,
- the column `gender` has the type `gender` (a special type defined in your database),
- there is a simple key defined on the `id_person` column (PRIMARY key),
- there is a compound key defined on the combination of the columns `first_name, last_name, nickname` (UNIQUE),
- there is a foreign key on the `id_location` column, so that it points to
the `location` table `id_location` column (`source: id_location; target: location(id_location)`).

And much more. Take time to examine the other tables as well so that you are acquainted with
the database structure.

### INSERT
The general syntax of the INSERT command is:

{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO table_name (list_of_columns) VALUES (list_of_values)
{% endhighlight %}

The INSERT statement inserts **rows** into a table.
When you look at the schema, you should see that the `location` table has the columns:
`id_location`, `city`, `street_name`, `street_number`, `zip`, `country`, `location`, `latitude`, `longitude`.
The column types of `latitude` and `longitude` is `numeric` which is a decimal number (GPS coordinates) and
the type of `id_location` and `street_number` is `integer`. All other columns have the type `character varying` which
is another name for a `string`. All of the columns except `id_location` allow
[`NULL`s](/articles/sql-join/#null) and
the column `id_location` has a default value, which means that the all of the columns are optional.
Columns with [automatically generated IDs](/articles/database-tech/#automatically-generated-key) -- such as `id_location` in this table -- are
almost never inserted.

Let's insert some data into the `location` table:

{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO location (name, city, street_name) VALUES ('La Tour Eiffel', 'Paris', 'Avenue Gustave Eiffel')
{% endhighlight %}

The order of the inserted values must match the order of the column names, this (obviously?) means that
there must be the same number of items in the column list and value list.
Try to run the query yourself in the Adminer:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Run SQL query](/common/database-intro/adminer-run-query.png)

Important: Unlike in HTML and PHP, in SQL, strings must always be enclosed in single
quotes `'`. Double quotes are **not allowed** for string values. Actually double quotes
are used to quote the column and table names.

You should see the result

    Query executed OK, 1 row affected.

Click on **select** next to the `location` table to verify that the row really got inserted into the table.
That's -- once you know the structure of the destination table, writing an SQL INSERT statement is easy.
Notice that there are two keywords used at the beginning of the query `INSERT INTO`. If you have some
programming background, this may look unusual to you. It is supposed to improve the readability of the
SQL query. In SQL it is quite common, so you better get used to it.

The list of the columns is not required, so the above query may also be shortened to:

{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO location VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Paris', 'Avenue Gustave Eiffel', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'La Tour Eiffel')
{% endhighlight %}

I highly discourage you from using this form of INSERT query in your application. It breaks as
soon as you make some modifications to the table. Also just from reading it, it is very hard
to understand what gets inserted where. It is better to be **explicit and verbose**.

#### DEFAULT and NULL
They keyword `DEFAULT` means that a default value of the column should be used (in the above case,
it is a [sequence](/articles/database-tech/#automatically-generated-key) value -- `nextval('location_id_location_seq'::regclass)`). The keyword
`NULL` means that no value will be inserted into that column.

If you don't list a column in the
INSERT query, then it is the same as if you listed it with the `DEFAULT` keyword.
Then it depends on the definition of the column:

- If the column has a default value, then that value is inserted.
- If the column has not a default value, then:
    - If the column allows NULLs, no value is inserted (NULL).
    - If the column requires a value (defined as `NOT NULL`), an error is raised -- a required value
    for the table column was not provided in the INSERT query

#### Working with Dates
Although dates are printed as strings, the database server stores them in a
[timestamp format](/articles/database-tech/#date-and-time). When inserting a date, you must make sure
that the server understands it correctly by either:

- supplying the date in the format expected by the server (usually `YYYY-MM-DD`),
- or explicitly converting the date with a conversion function.

The first option depends on the configuration of the database server, but
it is fairly common that this query works:

{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, nickname, birth_day)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Johnnie', '2010-12-24')
{% endhighlight %}

Using a conversion function is safer, but slightly more complicated. There are
a lot of differences between various database servers. However, the general principle
is that you supply date in an arbitrary format and a description of that format:

{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, nickname, birth_day)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Johnnie', TO_TIMESTAMP('24.12.2010', 'DD.MM.YYYY'),)
{% endhighlight %}

In the above query, I have used the
[TO_TIMESTAMP function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-formatting.html) of the PostgreSQL
database server. The first argument to the function is the date (in any format).
The second argument to that function is the format description with a
[formatting string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-formatting.html#FUNCTIONS-FORMATTING-DATETIME-TABLE).
This way you tell the server that the date
starts with two digits representing a date and followed by a dot.

{: .note}
The date conversion functions are specific to each database server. While they share
the same principle, they may have different names and parameters. Always consult the
manual of the database server you are using (look for the section 'Date conversion functions').

### UPDATE
The general syntax of the UPDATE command is:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE table_name SET list_of_modifications WHERE search_condition
{% endhighlight %}

The UPDATE command updates existing values in existing *rows* in the table. The *list_of_modifications*
is a list of assignments to be made. The *search_condition* is an expression which is evaluated for
each row and should yield a boolean value. If the *search_condition* is true, the corresponding row
is updated, otherwise it is skipped.

Let's update a row in the `location` table:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE location SET name = 'Arc de Triomphe', street_name = 'Place Charles de Gaulle'
    WHERE name = 'La Tour Eiffel'
{% endhighlight %}

{: .note}
Note that the same character `=` is used for both comparison (`WHERE` clause) and
assignment (`SET` clause). In SQL the actual function of the equal sign is determined by
the context. There is no `==` operator in SQL.

The search condition can be composed of multiple statements joined using the boolean operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.
Notice that you can reference a column in both the search condition and in the assignment (`name` in the
above example). Also, the new value of the column may be an expression, so it's valid to write e.g.:
`... SET age = age + 1 ...`.

#### Search condition
Important: the `WHERE` condition is not required, if you forget it,
**all rows in the table will be updated**. Also, notice that `NULL`s need to be
[treated specially](/articles/sql-join/#null).
Typically you use [key columns](/articles/relational-database/#key) in the search
condition to update a single record. Be careful
about this -- if you are using a [compound key](/articles/relational-database/#key-types),
then all columns of that key must be used
in the condition. Consider this query:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE person SET height = '135' WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe'
{% endhighlight %}

There is a compound key on the columns `first_name`, `last_name`, `nickname` defined on
the `persons` table (`UNIQUE (first_name, last_name, nickname)`). This guarantees that
the combination of the first name, last name and nickname of a person is unique
(in your database that is). However the combination of `first_name` and `last_name`
is **not guaranteed** to be unique and therefore the query **may** update more than
one person and therefore it is **wrong**. There are two correct options:

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE person SET height = '135'
WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe' AND nickname = 'Johnnie'
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE person SET height = '135' WHERE id_person='42'
{% endhighlight %}

{: .note}
Either of the above two solutions is fine, but any other solutions are wrong. When
you are modifying data in database, you must **make sure** that there is no possibility
of changing unwanted rows.

### DELETE
The general syntax of the DELETE command is:

{% highlight sql %}
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE search_condition
{% endhighlight %}

The `DELETE` command removes **entire rows** from the table. Same rules apply for the *search_condition* as in
the `UPDATE` statement. Including that -- if you forget the `WHERE` statement, then
**all rows of the table will be deleted!**.

Let's delete the row, we have just inserted:

{% highlight sql %}
DELETE FROM person WHERE id_person > 50
{% endhighlight %}

I have used the larger than `>` operator to delete any location inserted after the initial import.
You will usually use the equals `=` operator.

### SELECT
The general syntax of a *simple* SELECT command is:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT column_list FROM table_name WHERE search_condition ORDER BY list_of_orderings
{% endhighlight %}

The `SELECT` command returns rows of an existing table (or tables) and returns
them in the form of a table. The *column_list* is either a list of column names or
asterisk `*` to list all columns of the table.
The same rules apply to the *search_condition* as in the previous commands, including that
if you omit the `WHERE` statement altogether, all rows of a table will be returned.

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location WHERE id_location > 40
{% endhighlight %}

There are some [useful features](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-comparisons.html)
which you can use in the `WHERE` clause. You should
definitely be aware of the existence of `LIKE` and `IN` operators.

The `LIKE` operator is useful for selecting a string by a partial match. Use the percent sign `%` as
a placeholder for any number of characters:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location WHERE city LIKE 'B%'
{% endhighlight %}

The above example selects all locations where `city` starts with letter `B`.

The `IN` operator is useful for matching against a set of values. The following will select
all locations the city of which is one of those mentioned in the set (defined in the parenthesis):

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location WHERE city IN ('Praha', 'Paris', 'Bremen')
{% endhighlight %}

The set can be either enumerated as in the above example or it can be defined by another
[`SELECT` query](/articles/sql-aggregation/). To exclude set values from the result
use the `column NOT IN (...)` variant
(also with `NULL` value use `column IS NOT NULL`).

#### ORDER BY
Ordering of the results is possible by multiple criteria:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location ORDER BY city
{% endhighlight %}

Compare the result of the above query with the result of the below query. Look at multiple
rows with the same city - e.g. Brno.

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location ORDER BY city, street_name
{% endhighlight %}

Each column ordering can be further modified by the direction keyword either `ASC` (ascending sorting -- A-Z)
or `DESC` (descending sorting -- Z-A). If no direction is specified, then `ASC` is assumed.
Note that the direction must be specified for each column individually, so the
query

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location ORDER BY city, street_name DESC
{% endhighlight %}

Will not fully reverse the table, but the following query will:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM location ORDER BY city DESC, street_name DESC
{% endhighlight %}

Important: If you omit the `ORDER BY` statement, the rows in the result are
ordered randomly. You should therefore use defined ordering for every SELECT
whose result is displayed to the end-user.

## Task -- Insert
Insert a person named *Karl Oshiro*, with his nickname *hiromi*, gender = 'male' and height = 180.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO person (first_name, last_name, nickname, gender, height) VALUES
    ('Karl', 'Oshiro', 'hiromi', 'male', 180)
{% endhighlight %}

## Task -- Select
Select id_person of this *Karl Oshiro*, you have just inserted, make sure to return only a
single row.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT id_person FROM person
    WHERE first_name = 'Karl' AND last_name = 'Oshiro' AND nickname = 'hiromi'
{% endhighlight %}

## Task -- Update
Change the name of the *Karl Oshiro* you just inserted to *Carl Sohiro*, make sure
to update only a single row -- find the right ID in your database.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE person SET first_name = 'Carl', last_name = 'Oshiro' WHERE
    id_person = 49
{% endhighlight %}

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE person SET first_name = 'Carl', last_name = 'Oshiro' WHERE
    WHERE first_name = 'Karl' AND last_name = 'Oshiro' AND nickname = 'hiromi'
{% endhighlight %}

## Task -- Remove a value
Remove the value of `height` for *Carl Sohiro*.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
Hint: you must set the value to `NULL`.
{% endhighlight %}

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
UPDATE person SET height = NULL WHERE id_person = 49
{% endhighlight %}

You cannot use a `DELETE` command, because that deletes entire rows. Also you
mustn't set the value to 0, because there is a difference between 0 height and
an unknown height.

## Task -- Combined Search condition
Find all persons whose last names begin with **C** or **K** and their heights
are more than 170 centimeters.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
Hint: You'll need an `OR`, an `AND` and `LIKE`.
{% endhighlight %}

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
Hint: If you have the sample data, then three rows should be returned. If you got
more, double check the results.
{% endhighlight %}

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM person WHERE (last_name LIKE 'C%' OR last_name LIKE 'K%') AND height > 170
{% endhighlight %}

## Task -- Search Using a Set
Select all persons with names 'Gilda', 'Alisha' and 'Lisette' and order them so that
the tallest are shown first.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM person WHERE first_name IN ('Gilda', 'Alisha', 'Lisette') ORDER BY height ASC
{% endhighlight %}

## Task -- Search Using a Sub-select Set
Select all persons which have associated location in the `country` *United Kingdom* and order
them by the `last_name` column. Now you will need to write two `SELECT`s and connect them using the `IN`
operator.

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
Hint: Start by selecting `id_location` of the locations in the *United Kingdom*. You should
get 12 rows with the sample data.
</div>

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
Hint: Write a `SELECT` statement that uses the previous SELECT inside the parenthesis of the `IN` operator.
</div>

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM person WHERE id_location IN
(SELECT id_location FROM location WHERE country = 'United Kingdom')
ORDER BY last_name
{% endhighlight %}

## Task -- Select Everything
Just a verification -- select all rows and all columns from the persons table.

{: .solution}
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM person
{% endhighlight %}

## Summary
Now you should know how to work with a relational database. There is [much more to come](/articles/sql-join/), but
so far, you should be able to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` data. This is
sufficient to create a reasonably working web application. Just note that some techniques have not been
revealed to you yet -- be patient and read on! If you do not know how to do something
(find ID of an inserted row, limit the amount of returned results, calculate the number of entries...)
do not try to come up with your own solution, database systems are widely used for many years
and there are tools and procedures how to do these things correctly.
You should be familiar with the general syntax of SQL statements, the common key words, and
SQL specific operators (`LIKE`, `IN`). Do not be afraid to experiment with your database,
you can always delete it (and import it again) by using the SQL queries:

{% highlight sql %}
    DROP TABLE relation CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE relation_type CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE contact CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE contact_type CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE person_meeting CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE meeting CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE person CASCADE;
    DROP TABLE location CASCADE;
    DROP TYPE gender;
{% endhighlight %}
