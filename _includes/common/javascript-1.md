Sometimes a quick popup alert or a confirmation dialog is the best solution to displaying a notification or question
to a website visitor. Imagine that you have to write a PHP script and a template to confirm deletion
of a record -- it would be a lot of code. You probably saw a dialog with native look of the operating system
on other websites. Such dialog can be displayed using a [JavaScript](/articles/javascript/) code and it
is a built-int part of the browser ([frontend](/articles/web-applications/#frontend)).

In this article I will not teach you how to build an application entirely with JavaScript. I will show you how to use
very basic functions of this language to overcome the most common problems with the user interface -- quickly confirm some action or
validate a form before it is send to the [backend](/articles/web-applications/#backend).

## Linking JavaScript to your HTML
[Similarly to CSS](../css/#linking-your-css-to-html-file), a JavaScript file is usually referenced in the `<head>`
element using a `<script>` tag (however it may be placed in other parts of the HTML too).
The `<script>` tag can contain either an URL to download a script or it can directly contain some
JavaScript code:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/attach.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, the actual JavaScript code is `console.log("Some message.");` and `console.log("Another message.");`.

The basic JavaScript syntax is described in a separate [article](/articles/javascript/#javascript-basics).
The `console` is a global object that represents [browser's developer console](/course/not-a-student/#web-browser)
(usually activated by F12 key). The `log()` method puts some output into it. You should have the console activated every time
you develop some JavaScript functionality. Therefore the above code would print two messages in the console.

## Working with Elements and attributes
The source code of the linked scripts is executed immediately in the order of the `<script>` tag appearances. Usually you want
to *attach some [event handlers](/articles/javascript/#javascript-events)* --- execute a piece of code after a visitor
performs some action (e.g. clicks a button). Event handlers can be attached to general events which take place globally
(like loading the whole page or scrolling the window) or to events that take place on a particular HTML element (clicking on
an element or focusing an element). To attach functionality to an element event, you have to find the element first
and then attach the handler in the JavaScript code.

There are multiple functions for locating HTML elements --- the easiest one is
`document.getElementById("id_of_element")` which can find and return one element using its `id`
attribute, `document` is a global object which contains the [tree structure](/articles/html/#hierarchical-structure) of your HTML elements.

Other useful functions to retrieve HTML elements:

- `document.getElementsByTagName("table")` --- returns an array of elements with a given tag name (i.e. all `<table>` elements)
- `document.getElementsByClassName("some-class")` --- returns an array of elements with a given `class` attribute
- `document.querySelector(".some-css-selector")` --- returns the first element matched by a given [CSS selector](/articles/css/#selectors)
- `document.querySelectorAll(".some-css-selector")` --- returns an array of elements matched by a given [CSS selector](/articles/css/#selectors)

When you have elements, you can access their HTML attributes by their standard names (e.g. `console.log(link.href)` for
an `<a>` element). An exception is the `class` attribute which must be accessed using the `element.className` property.
To change the CSS styles use the `element.style` object followed by the [*camelCase*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) CSS property name (e.g. the
CSS property `background-color` can be accessed with
`element.style.backgroundColor`). Another special attribute is `innerHTML` which can be used to change the content of an
element. You may remember about [user defined attributes](/articles/html/#data-attributes) which can be accessed
in the `element.dataset` object (e.g. `element.dataset.personid` for `data-personId` attribute).

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/html-attributes-styles.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{: .note}
Although it is possible, you should avoid changing particular CSS styles like in the above example. It is tedious and
makes your code confusing. You should rather add or remove CSS classes (there is a [`classList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/cs/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)
field of the HTML element which allows efficient work with CSS classes).

## Working with Events
As described above, various *events* occur on the web page, either automatically, or through user interaction.
To be able to respond to events, you need to **register a handler** (or **subscribe for an event**). A *handler*
is a piece of code which *handles* the event (i.e. does something in response to that event).
The event handler is also commonly called a *callback* (as a piece of code which is "called back" from
an event situation).

Basic [event registration](/articles/javascript/#javascript-events) can be performed in the same manner
as [working with standard HTML properties](#working-with-elements) --- event
handlers are attributes of the HTML elements. The limitation of this basic approach is that you can attach only one
event handler to each type of event. You can attach [multiple events](/articles/javascript/#javascript-events)
using the `addEventListener('event', handler)` method of the element object.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/basic-events.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you are new to Javascript (or any programming) you may be confused by the line `window.onload = function() { ... }`.
This is indeed something new. The `onload` property expects to be assigned a *handler* (which is a piece of code). And
that is exactly what that line does, it assigns a function which has no name and no parameters to the `onload` property
of `window` object. A function which has no name is called *anonymous function*. The same applies to line
`<button onclick="callMe()">` where I assigned the code `callMe()` as the onclick handler body. Identifier *callMe*
represents a function which I have declared earlier. The brackets are there to actually call that function once the
event occurs and the handler is executed.

It might help you to write `<button onclick="callMe();">` where the semicolon emphasizes that the attribute content
is an actual line of JavaScript code. You can even put more function calls or other valid JavaScript expressions into
the attribute body and divide them with semicolons. It is important that the function is called in the handler, i.e. it
is insufficient to write only `<button onclick="callMe">` because `onclick` attribute contains the actual *code*
of an anonymous function.

Take a look on the line with `onclick="alert('Hello')"`. See how I mixed two kinds of quotes? I used double quotes to
enclose the JavaScript code, which is just a attribute value (a string) from HTML's point of view. Inside the JavaScript
code I used single quotes to enclose string parameter for the `alert(str)` function. I cannot use double quotes for both
cases (`onclick="alert("Hello")"`) because HTML parser would stop at the second double quote and thus making the
JavaScript code invalid (`alert(` only). You can swap the quotes if you want: `onclick='alert("Hello")'`.

{: .note}
The above is still an example. A cleaner approach is to divide the HTML and the JavaScript code and attach the events
in JavaScript. Also imagine how ugly it looks if you write complex code inside the `onclick` attribute of an HTML element.

## Manipulating HTML
The same way you can manipulate HTML attributes, you can also manipulate with the elements themselves. This means that
the HTML code can be changed **dynamically** when something happens on the page.

Each element can have a set of child nodes, which can be manipulated using `appendChild` and `removeChild` methods. For example, you can
remove or add children (`elem2`) to an HTML element `elem` with `elem1.appendChild(elem2)` and `elem1.removeChild(elem2)`.
To create a new element you can use `document.createElement` method - e.g. `var newElem = document.createElement("<p>")` to create a new paragraph.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/creating-elements.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, first I create a list `ul` element (`newList` variable). Then I pick an existing HTML element (with id `container`) and
add the list as a child of the container. Then I add two items to the list. Notice the difference between assigning `innerHTML` and `textContent` (or `innerText`) attribute.
The latter is much safer approach, not susceptible to [XSS attacks](/articles/security/xss/).

{: .note}
All of this is possible thanks to [*DHTML* (dynamic HTML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML). It is an ability
of the web browser that allows it to change actual rendering of a page after HTML structure change made with JavaScript
takes place.

### Task -- Toggle Class Using a Button Click
Make a button and some HTML element with an `id` attribute. Attach a click event to the button using an `onclick` attribute.
Toggle CSS class named `highlight` on the element with the `id` using the `element.classList.toggle('className')` method.
You also need to define the CSS class `highlight` with some visual properties defined (e.g. green border).

{% include /common/javascript/events-toggle-css.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{: .note}
If you came up with another solution, do not worry, there are always multiple working solutions when you write any code.

## Confirm User Actions
In the chapter about [records deletion](../backend-delete/), you were referred to this article for
information about how to confirm a user action. Using JavaScript, we can prevent the visitor's browser from sending
a HTTP request (i.e. following a link or sending a form). This is called *preventing navigation* and might be useful for
example when the user is filling a form and you want to make sure that she does not accidentally leave the page (and loose the filled form).
Here is an example how to prevent navigation with a confirm popup for basic `<a>` element:

If you want to prevent navigation on a form, you have to use the `onsubmit` event:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/prevent-nav-form.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

You have to pass a true/false value returned by the `confirm` function from the called `confirmForm()` function
using the `return` keyword in the `onsubmit` attribute. This is because the attribute itself is the body of the event
handler function and has to return `true` or `false` to approve or cancel from submission.

Similar confirmation can be created on links:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/prevent-nav-a.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, the handler must return a boolean value from the `confirmNav` function.

### Task -- Pass Parameters to the Handler
Let's create and alert for a form which takes some parameters. I have slightly modified the example above, there
are now two forms, but we would still like to use the same `confirmForm` function.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/prevent-nav-form-parameters-1.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

Modify the code so that you pass a parameter to the `confirmForm`, and display appropriate confirmation message.

{: .solution}
{% highlight html %}
{% include /common/javascript/prevent-nav-form-parameters-2.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

There are many different solutions. In the solution above, I used the `+` operator to concatenate strings in
the message and I directly passed the action being confirmed. The `+` operator in Javascript works both for
adding numbers and concatenating strings.
