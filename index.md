**[APV Course outline](/course/)**

This web book is an introduction to the development of web applications. It consists of two
walkthroughs --- [**Classic Walkthrough**](/walkthrough/) and [**Slim Walkthrough**](/walkthrough-slim/)
which will guide you through making the web application step by step and [**Articles**](/articles/) explaining the
details of all the used technologies.

## Why two Walkthroughs?
Because there are many completely different approaches to build a web application.

- The [**Classic Walkthrough**](/walkthrough/) goes to the roots and is great for general understanding. It uses
raw mostly procedural PHP and no PHP framework. HTML is rendered using Latte Templates.
-  The [**Slim Walkthrough**](/walkthrough-slim/) uses the Slim PHP framework. It represents a quicker way to the goal, but there
is some magic involved. HTML is also rendered using Latte Templates.

Both Walkthroughs share some parts (e.g. HTML, HTML forms, SQL), the difference is mainly in the way the PHP code on
backend is organized.
Note that for **[APV Course outline](/course/)**, the [**Slim Walkthrough**](/walkthrough-slim/) is the current one.

## Goals
My goals are:

- to show you how web applications can be made (using SQL, PHP, JavaScript);
- to teach you enough programming so that you can put together a web application;
- to teach you something about [software engineering](/articles/programming/#software-engineering);
- to show you how stuff works and **why** it works that way;
- to explain the principles which last for a long time.
- to show you how things should be done properly (aka professionally);
- to have an [opensource book](https://github.com/ujpef/site).

My goals are **not**:

- to teach you [Computer Science](/articles/programming/#computer-science);
- to make an excellent (PHP, JavaScript, SQL, ...) programmer out of you. That needs much more practice, but this
may be a good start;
- to show you all the technical details;
- to make an (UX, Software Architect, Testing, ...) expert out of you (that needs much more than reading a single book,
but this may be a good start).

## Who? Why?
*Who is this for?* This book was originally written for students of
[Application Software Programmes](http://ects-prog.mendelu.cz/en/plan6937/predmet88060) course
at [Mendel University](https://is.mendelu.cz/). However it is suitable for [anyone](/course/not-a-student/)
with interest in web application development.

*Why web applications?* Because they are popular and they
allow [Rapid Application Development (RAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development).
Starting with web applications is probably the easiest entry into the world of software development.
However, I wouldn't dare to say that developing good web applications is easy. But they are **easy to
start with**, as you can see the results quickly and many things are solved already. Web applications
also require the use of many different technologies, therefore they force you to be more open minded.

*Why I have written this book?* Because most of the articles and tutorials on the web are focused on a single technology.
Most tutorials contain only the tutorial without explaining what's happening. And most of the articles (which
explain what's happening) lack the tutorial to show how to work with it. As such it is really difficult for
beginners to get the big picture of things and understand the principles. As I concentrate on the
big picture, I will leave out many of the technical details (which change very often) -- I expect
you to [google them](http://lmgtfy.com/) for yourself. Many of the technical details are presented
along the way, but they are not really important. Also this book concentrates on showing you how things
should be done properly, so that you produce professional and reliable applications.

*Who am I?* Main authors of this book are [Ondrej Popelka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/odinuv/) and [Jiri Lysek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiri-lysek/).
We were teachers of APV course at [Mendel University in Brno](http://mendelu.cz/en/)
in the past years. This course is currently maintained by [Jan Kolomaznik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-kolomazn%C3%ADk-137925160/).
