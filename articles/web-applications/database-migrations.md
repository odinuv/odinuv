There is a problem with changes in the database structure when you work in a team and with multiple environments where
your application is running (e.g. your development machine, other programmers' development machines, testing server,
production server...). When a developer makes a change in the database structure, this change has to be propagated to
other databases used by all instances of one application.

Try to think in larger scale: an application installed on multiple machines, developed by many programmers during many
months or even years and regularly updated/modified based on users' requirements.

You can have a special discussion thread in your team's communication tool (e.g. [Slack](https://slack.com))
or you can give a phone call to all other programmers and tell them concrete instructions to change their database
tables. A better way is to write SQL queries into a file and commit these files into Git. It is a good idea to use
current date as a name for such file, e.g. `2018-10-20_add-account-table.sql`.

It definitely means that instead of clicking in a tool like Adminer or phpMyAdmin, you simply write a piece of
SQL code which describes the database changes you want.

This is all very tedious and people tend to forget to propagate database changes or check for database changes
periodically. Even the "SQL file with updates" approach is problematic as one has to copy&paste all SQL codes file
by file when there are more changes or you are making a fresh install. Plus you do have to remember last SQL patch
file you used. The answer to all these problems is: *use migrations*.

A *database migration* is a programmatic way to describe database changes. It is very similar to "SQL file with updates"
approach but it is managed by a software tool and you do not have to remember last migration used and installing new
database or updating existing structure is a matter of **one single command** in the console.

## How does it work
In PHP word, a database migration is a simple PHP file where you can either use some kind of API to perform database
modifications or you can directly execute a SQL query. A database migration can also be used to define default data
(e.g. dials like `contact_type` or `relation_type`). Some database migration systems can also be used to *undo* changes.
The *undo* ability is useful when switching branches in Git. The migration tool remembers migrated files (usually
in a database table) and when you execute migrate command, only newly created migrations are executed. Similarly,
the *rollback* (undo) command finds last batch of migrations and reverts them from database structure.

Here is an example of database migration from [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/) based application:

~~~ php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class Persons extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
		Schema::create('person', function(Blueprint $table) {
			$table->increments('id');
            $table->string('nickname', 100);
            $table->string('first_name', 100);
            $table->string('last_name', 100);
            $table->integer('id_location')->unsigned()->nullable();
            $table->date('birth_day')->nullable();
            $table->integer('height')->unsigned()->nullable();
            $table->timestamps();

			$table->unique(['nickname', 'first_name', 'last_name']);
			$table->foreign('id_location')->references('id')->on('location')->onDelete('cascade');
		});
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::drop('person');
    }
}
~~~

You can see that the `up` method creates a new table called `person` with all columns, their data-types and keys. It
even creates a foreign key to `location` table (that table has to be created beforehand in another migration file).
The `down` method is there to perform *undo* action -- it simply drops the table here.

To execute the migration in Laravel based project, just type `php artisan migrate` to execute the `up` part or `php
artisan migrate:rollback` to execute the `down` part. You can create multiple migration scripts and they are executed
all at once (in a batch) when the *migrate* command is executed. File names of all migrated scripts are stored in
a database table with same timestamp. The *rollback* command may also executes multiple scripts as they were migrated
together -- the timestamp in DB is the same. Database records about migrated scripts are deleted after *rollback*.

### What happens when migration fails
Sometimes a migration fails during database structure changes. It may result in partial changes of database structure,
it is sometimes needed to revert changes by hand or delete whole database and migrate everything from scratch after
fixing the migration script. You should always test the migration script before committing them into Git. The rollback
or undo command is unfortunately useless in this situation because the migration or rollback only works in batches.

{: .note}
This is actually the largest problem of programmatic migrations. You should be very careful when you design the
migration because there can be side-effects especially with a database with real-world data. Always make a backup
before executing migrations on production server!

## Writing migrations using Phinx
The example presented above is specific for Laravel framework. I will use [Phinx](https://phinx.org/) migration system
to present a small example of migrations usage on the course project. I will create a migration for `account` table
from [Login walkthrough](/walkthrough-slim/login/).

We have to download Phinx first using [Composer](/course/technical-support/#composer).

~~~ bash
composer require robmorgan/phinx
# OR when you have composer.phar file in your project root
php composer.phar require robmorgan/phinx
~~~

This command created a Phinx executable file in the `vendor/bin` subfolder of your project. There is a `phinx.bat` file
for Windows and `phinx` shell script for Linux. Type `vendor\bin\phinx` (Windows) or `vendor/bin/phinx` (Linux) to
execute Phinx from your project root. You should get similar output with Phinx usage description:

![Phinx command](/articles/web-applications/phinx-command.png)

{: .note}
I will use Linux style commands from now on. Just change `/` to `\` on Windows OS.

Phinx will need database credentials to access your database. We can use `vendor/bin/phinx init .` command to
initialize config and then open `phinx.yml` in your editor. The config file contains DB credentials for different
environments. This file unfortunately duplicates values from `.env` file and is static (you will have to commit
your database credentials into Git). I will therefore not use `phinx.yml` file to store database credentials.
I will rather create a dynamic Phinx config using `phinx.php` file -- it will gather database credentials from
our settings in the `src/settings.php` file (which loads the `.env` file).

The `phinx.php` file (place in the root directory of your project):

~~~ php
<?php
require_once './vendor/autoload.php';
$settings = require './src/settings.php';
$config = $settings['settings']['db'];
return [
    'paths'                => [
        'migrations' => 'migrations', //migration folder - create manually
        'seeds'      => 'seeds',      //seeds folder - create manually
    ],
    'environments' => [
        'default_migration_table' => 'migrations',
        'default_database'        => 'development',
        'development'             => [
            'adapter'   => $config['dbtype'],
            'host'      => $config['dbhost'],
            'name'      => $config['dbname'],
            'user'      => $config['dbuser'],
            'pass'      => $config['dbpass'],
            'port'      => 5432,
            'charset'   => 'utf8',
            'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
            'prefix'    => '',
        ],
        'production'              => [
            'adapter'   => $config['dbtype'],
            'host'      => $config['dbhost'],
            'name'      => $config['dbname'],
            'user'      => $config['dbuser'],
            'pass'      => $config['dbpass'],
            'port'      => 5432,
            'charset'   => 'utf8',
            'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
            'prefix'    => '',
        ],
    ],
];
~~~

Before creating your first migration, you have to create the `migrations` folder -- just type `mkdir migrations` or
use your file manager to create this directory. To create a migration use following command:

~~~ bash
vendor/bin/phinx create Account
~~~

This should create a file named like `20181114092000_account.php` in `migrations` folder. You will find a method called
`change` in this file. You should specify the modifications you want to make in your database. Take a look at
[Phinx table documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/migrations.html#working-with-tables) and
[Phinx column documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/migrations.html#working-with-columns) to understand the API
and see allowed column types. Our migration can look like this:

~~~ php
<?php

use Phinx\Migration\AbstractMigration;

class Account extends AbstractMigration
{
    public function change()
    {
        $table = $this->table(
            'account',                                          //table name
            ['id' => false, 'primary_key' => ['id_account']]    //specify primary key
        );
        $table->addColumn('id_account', 'integer', ['identity' => true])    //set auto-increment
            ->addColumn('login', 'string', ['limit' => 100])
            ->addColumn('password', 'string', ['limit' => 255])
            ->addIndex(['login'], ['unique' => true])
            ->create();
    }
}
~~~

{: .note}
Maybe you noticed that Phinx migration does not contain `up()` method for forward migration and `down()` methods for
rollback by default. The `change()` method is used to define *reversible* migrations -- the system can figure out the
rollback steps if you obey [specific](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/migrations.html) rules.
You can specify custom `up()` and `down()` methods. Using the `change()` method is preferred though, but you cannot
use direct SQL code.

Finally, we can migrate the database changes described in migrations folder by using this command:

~~~ bash
vendor/bin/phinx migrate
~~~

There should be a new database table called `account` with three columns:

![Migrated table](/articles/web-applications/migrated-table.png)

Check out the `migrations` table to see migrations log. To *undo* or *rollback* the migration use
`vendor/bin/phinx rollback` command.

![Migrations](/articles/web-applications/migrations.png)

You might have noticed, that there are multiple *environments* in the `phinx.php` or `phinx.yml` file. To use settings
for *production* environment (or any other environment) use `-e` switch, e.g.: `vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e production`.

{: .note}
We do not need to differentiate between environments in our case (note that the values used in `phinx.php` are same),
because we have different `.env` file for each instance of the application.

## Database seeding
Seeding is similar to migrations but it focuses on data, not on database structure. Sometimes you need to install your
application with some predefined data in particular tables (e.g. dials for relation and contact type).
Or perhaps you want to setup some default user into the account table, create the seeding file first:

~~~ bash
# remember to create the directory first
mkdir seeds
# create the seeder file
vendor/bin/phinx seed:create Admin
~~~

Specify seeding procedure:

~~~ php
<?php

use Phinx\Seed\AbstractSeed;

class Admin extends AbstractSeed
{
    public function run()
    {
        $data = [
            [
                'login'    => 'admin',
                'password' => password_hash('pass', PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
            ]
        ];

        $table = $this->table('account');
        $table->insert($data)->save();
    }
}
~~~

Run the seeder: `vendor/bin/phinx seed:run`. The result should look like this (the password hash will differ).

![Seeded table](/articles/web-applications/seeded-table.png)

{: .note}
You can use seeding only to setup development/testing environment and default values for dials can be inserted using
standard migrations.

## Summary
It does not matter whether you use Phinx or other migration tool. The ides behind and workflow is very similar.

The benefit of using database migrations is that the process can also be automated. You can create a simple bash script
for each fresh install or database update and this script can be executed when you pull new code from main Git
repository using hooks (use `post-merge` hook).

Migrations are also very useful for [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) because
you do not want to setup the database by hand each time you reset the container. Docker container can also execute
migration script on start automatically.
