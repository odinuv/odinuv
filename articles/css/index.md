In the [previous article](/articles/html/), you learned about HTML. You
probably noticed that HTML completely lacks any means to define how a
HTML document will look. This is where styles come into scene. In this article,
I will explain what styles are and how they work.

Although, there was a [brief period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Presentation) when HTML allowed changing the visual style of a
document, the truth is that HTML is a language to describe a structure of a document.
HTML has no means to describe visual **rendering** of a document. This is somewhat counter-intuitive
because when you create an HTML document without any styles, it still renders somehow -- e.g.
`H1` header has larger font size, is in bold and has some margins etc. This is caused by
styles built in a web browser. These are called [user-agent](/articles/web/#www-service) styles and are shipped with
every web browser so that it renders an HTML page without styles in some sensible manner.

## Cascading Style Sheets
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is standard defining the rendering **rules** for a HTML (or
[XML](/articles/html/#xml) or [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)) documents
and a language for writing those rules. CSS is not a programming language.

CSS replaces obsolete HTML elements like `FONT`, `BASEFONT`, `BIG`, `CENTER`, `S`, `STRIKE`, `U`, ...
It is being actively developed with varying support among browsers. When you plan using a recent
feature, check its support with various browser tests:

- [http://caniuse.com/](http://caniuse.com/)
- [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/)
- [http://acid3.acidtests.org/](http://acid3.acidtests.org/)
- [http://css3test.com/](http://css3test.com/)
- [http://tools.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html](http://tools.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html)

CSS version 2 (2.1) is almost fully supported among all common browsers. Starting with CSS3, the
standard is split into **modules** with various degrees of standardization (earliest 2007). There are
dozens of modules: font properties, color, box properties, box model, border, color, margin, background,
size and even effects like shadows, transparency,
rounded corners or mouse cursor and [many more](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/)
(See [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)).

### Page Layout
Creating styles for a full HTML page is quite a complex task. Because a web page is not a piece of
paper, the styles must adapt to virtually unlimited number of page (window) sizes. This leads
us to [**responsive design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) which basically is page
design in which the page layout changes with the page size. This means that some elements are shown only when
there is enough space for them and other page elements are resized accordingly. Creating
a clean good looking responsive page, which displays nicely on desktop with
[screen resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution) 1920 &times; 1080 as well as on a mobile
phone with screen resolution 320 &times; 480 is really difficult. It is comparable to developing an entire
application as it requires design and graphical skills as well as *deep understanding* of CSS rendering
modes and all available options. It also requires fairly good understating of HTML and experience so that
you can design a good page layout
(not to be confused with [layout template](/walkthrough-slim/templates-layout/)).

Simply put, a **page layout** describes the arrangement (position and sizes) of all page elements (e.g. paragraphs).
Luckily, there is plenty of ready to use [page layouts](#summary) which
solve this problem. Many of those are available for free and are can be easily customized. So I suggest
that you start with any of them rather than trying to develop your own page layout and styles from
scratch. However it is still important that you understand how CSS works so that you can customize your template and do little
tweaks to it.

### CSS Syntax
Even though creating an entire page stylesheet is complicated, the syntax of a CSS file is
<span title='it is like bricks, they are simple and anyone can use them, but building an entire house is not that easy'>
fairly simple</span>.
A CSS document contains **rules**, **selectors** and **properties** and their values.
CSS **rule** is composed of a selector and a set of properties and their values. CSS rule is written down as:

{% highlight css %}
selector {
    property1: value2;
    property2: value2;
}
{% endhighlight %}

For example the rule `body {color: black;}` sets black font color to the `<body>` element of HTML page.
Any number of properties can be set in a single rule. The properties in a rule are separated by semicolon `;`.
The rules are separated by new line, so there is no semicolon after the parentheses.
That's all. It is still very powerful.

### Selectors
A selector is something with selects HTML elements whose properties are modified. There are four
basic kinds of selectors:

- element name ([type selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors)) -- `a {color: red}`
- element class ([class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors)) -- `.contact_link {color: grey}`
    - pseudo-classes -- `:visited {color: blue}`
- element id ([id selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)) -- `#homepage_contact {color: green}`
- element attribute ([attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)) -- `input[type=text] {color: black}`
- [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) -- `*` -- matches every element.

With the above CSS style:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-1.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

the following HTML document:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-1.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

will display like this (when the link is not visited):

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Sample page Unvisited](/articles/css/sample-page-1a.png)

And when the link is visited, the HTML document will display like this:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Sample page Visited](/articles/css/sample-page-1b.png)

I will explain why all of the links are not blue [in a moment](#overriding).

### Pseudo-classes
Pseudo-class selectors refer to things which cannot be easily represented
in the HTML language. A typical example is the `:visited` selector, which
selects visited HTML links. This is something which refers to the **state** of the
browser and there is no way to represent it in the HTML code itself.

There are a number of other pseudo-classes ([full list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)):

- `:link` -- unvisited link
- `:visited` -- visited link
- `:active` -- active link
- `:focus` -- focused input
- `:checked` -- checked input, same as `input[checked]`
- `:disabled` -- disabled input, same as `input[disabled]`
- `:valid` -- valid input
- `:invalid` -- invalid input
- `:required` -- required input, same as `input[required]`
- `:first-child` -- first matched element in the same parent, e.g.: `li:first-child` selects first `<li>`
- `:nth-child(2)` -- second matched element in the same parent
- `:nth-child(even)` and `:nth-child(odd)` -- even and odd elements
- `:nth-child(3n+2)`-- every third beginning from the second element

### Combining Selectors
The CSS selectors may be quite freely combined. Common combine operators (combinators) are:

- nothing -- a [logical and](/articles/programming/#boolean-type) -- If both first and second selector apply, the element properties are modified.
- colon `,` -- a [logical or](/articles/programming/#boolean-type) -- If either first or second selector applies, the element properties are modified.
- space -- [descendant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors) -- Properties are modified for the elements selected by
the second selector which is applied only **within** the elements selected by the first selector.
- greater `>` -- [direct child](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_selectors) --
Properties are modified only for elements selected by the second selector
which is applied only to *direct children* of elements selected by the first selector. Now, it
really becomes vital to understand the
[hierarchical structure of HTML](/articles/html/#hierarchical-structure) page.
- tilde `~` -- [sibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors) --
Properties are modified for the elements selected by the second selector if that element
is preceded by a sibling element satisfying the first selector.
- plus `+` -- [adjacent sibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors) --
Properties are modified for the elements selected by the second selector if that element
is **immediately** preceded by a sibling element satisfying the first selector.

Selector combinations examples:

- `ul, ol` -- selects all elements that are either `ul` or `ol`,
- `ul li` -- selects all elements `li` that are contained in `ul`,
- `ul>li` -- selects all elements `li` that are direct children of `ul`,
- `ul.menu` -- selects all elements `ul` that have class `menu` (logical and),
- `ul.menu a:visited` -- selects all visited links inside all `ul` elements that have class `menu`,
- `li#special a:visited` -- selects all visited links with inside all `li` elements which have id `special` (there should be only one).
- `li ~ li` -- selects all `li` elements which are preceded by some other sibling `li` element.

You will see those selectors in action in an [example](/articles/css/#selector-combinators).

### Vendor prefix
Properties, which are not fully standardized yet, or which are not implemented up to the standard may be
available with a **vendor prefix**. For example:

{% highlight css %}
.shadow {
    -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px #888; /* old Safari and Chrome */
    -moz-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px #888; /* old Firefox */
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px #888; /* all browsers that support this feature */
}
{% endhighlight css %}

There can be a bit of confusion about support of newest CSS properties in different web browsers. The
vendor prefixes are used for CSS properties which behavior is marked as experimental by the
authors of that web browsers. The important part here is that a web browser simply ignores all
properties it does not understand. Therefore the above code works, because

- A browser that supports `box-shadow` property ignores both `-webkit-box-shadow` and `-mox-box-shadow`.
- An old version of Firefox that does not understand the `box-shadow` property will read the `-mox-box-shadow` and
ignore the `box-shadow` and `-webkit-box-shadow`. The result it not guaranteed to be the same.

Using vendor prefixed properties is generally discouraged. They should be used if you want to be an
early adopter of that particular feature or if you need to support older versions of some browsers.
Thought it is better to use a [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill).

## Connecting styles with HTML
Because HTML and CSS are two completely different (and quite unrelated) languages. You have to connect
them somehow. There are basically three options:

- link to an external file,
- inside a `<style>` element,
- inside a `style` attribute (inline).

All three approaches may be freely combined within a HTML page.

### External file
Linking to external stylesheet is done using the `link` element in page head:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='style.css'>
        <title>SomePage</title>
        <meta charset='UTF-8'>
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

The `href` attribute is the URL of the style sheet. In the above case, it is
relative URL pointing to the `style.css` file in the same directory as the HTML
page itself. The type attribute is [MIME Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) and for CSS stylesheets it
should always be `text/css`. You can link as many stylesheets as you want
simply by using more `link` elements.

This is the most common approach. It lets you link many stylesheets which allows
you to organize them somehow so that you don't need to have a single incredibly
long CSS file. It also allows sharing styles between different sites (usually
styles for libraries -- e.g. [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/))

The only disadvantage of this approach is that it means that the browser has to
sent another HTTP request for each linked style. This may cause a performance
hit on the page loading which in turn may be avoided by setting up [HTTP caching](/walkthrough-slim/upload/#caching).

### Inside Page
{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>SomePage</title>
        <meta charset='UTF-8'>
        <style type='text/css'>
            body {color: green;}
        </style>
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

This approach allows you to set CSS for a single HTML page. It is used for pages
which are entirely different. For example in most applications all pages
look more or less the same and they certainly share most of the styles to maintain a consistent
look & feel of the application. An exception to this would be the login page which usually looks completely
different -- it has different layout, no menu, only a simple form, etc.

The `<style>` element is therefore used in cases where it does not make sense to share
styles with the rest of the application. Alternatively it can be used to lower the
number of HTTP requests. Note that it *is not* a good idea to include CSS files in the page
(e.g. using PHP [`require`](/walkthrough#/backend-intro/divide-and-conquer)) because the HTML page will
get unnecessarily large, it is better to set up [HTTP caching](/walkthrough-slim/upload/#caching).

### Inline
Third (quick & dirty) option is to include styles in the `style` attribute:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
        <p style='color: red; font-weight: bold'>This text will be bold red.</p>
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

When using this approach, only the CSS properties are used. Using CSS selector makes no
sense, because the properties are applied only to the element (and its children) to which they are entered.
This means that inline styles should be used only for exceptions from the the page styles.
Otherwise the inline styles bear a lot of repetition and they cause a huge mess.

## Inheritance & Cascading
Although the syntax for writing down CSS rules is pretty simple, the system through which these rules
are applied is pretty complex. Inheritance and Cascading are two primary concepts which are used by
web browsers to decide what an HTML element will look like.

### Inheritance
Some properties defined for parent elements are **inherited** to child elements (again remember that HTML is hierarchical
structure of elements). The top element is `body`
(in [some cases](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4565942/should-global-css-styles-be-set-on-the-html-element-or-the-body-element) `html` is also used).
This means that the rule:

{% highlight css %}
body {
    color: green;
}
{% endhighlight %}

sets font color to the `body` element. The setting is then inherited by all
of its child elements. And because all visible HTML elements
must be contained in the `body` element, it sets font color green for the entire document.
The rule can be **overridden** in child elements. E.g. I can create the following HTML page:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-3.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

Add the following CSS:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-3.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, the body font color is set to blue. But for all `p` elements, it is set to
black. The latter rule overrides the former rule and makes all paragraphs black. You can see the
overriding in [developer tools](/course/not-a-student/#web-browser) where the overridden property value is crossed out.

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Sample page](/articles/css/sample-page-3.png)

Not all CSS properties are inherited. Because there are [hundreds of available CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).
Remembering a list of inherited and non-inherited properties is not practical. But if you use common sense
judgement you'll probably figure it out on your own. E.g. it does not make any sense to inherit
any properties related to element size (width, height, margin, padding) because a child element with the
same size as the parent element would not fit inside that parent element.

#### Background
One property which you may find particularly confusing is background, which is not inherited but it looks as if it is
inherited. By default, each HTML element has no background. When an element has no background it
is transparent, therefore you can see the parent element underneath. For example:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-4.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-4.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you look at the above page in [developer tools](/course/not-a-student/#web-browser), you will see the following:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - Sample page](/articles/css/sample-page-4.png)

I.e. you can see that the `ul` element has no background, and you can see its parent through it -- the `body`
element with the green background. You can also see that there is not any overridden background for the `p` element.

### Cascading
There are multiple places where a style declaration can be placed (inline, external styles, ...) and multiple options
how an element can be selected. Each property can also be specified any number of times. All this leads to
a pretty complicated system in which some property values are inherited and then overridden by some
other declaration somewhere else (I have showed simple overriding in the above paragraph).

Cascading stylesheets resolve these conflicts by the **Cascade**. The cascade is a system in which all
values for a single property are put together and sorted by priority, the winning (cascaded) value is then
applied to the element. The cascade is a rather complex system, however it works pretty intuitively. The
following simplified rules are applied in the cascade:

- [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) -- more specific selectors override
less specific selectors. For basic selectors this means that
id selector (e.g. `#someId`) overrides class selector (e.g. `.someClass`) which overrides type selector (e.g. `ul`).
This gets more complicated in complex selectors but the rule of thumb is that a more specific rule wins
over a generic one. I.e. `p.firstParagraph` is more specific than `.firstParagraph` which is more specific than `p` selector.
There is an [exact formula](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity) for computing selector specificity.
- origin and importance -- author styles (provided in the page source by you) override the user-agent
styles (provided by the web browser). This can also be modified by the
[`!important` rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#The_!important_exception).
- scope -- a style with scope overrides a style without scope, the typical case is inline style which
applies only to certain part of the HTML document (scope) and overrides the styles assigned to the entire document.
- order of appearance -- the last declaration of property wins (applies only when none of the above resolve the priority)

Bear in mind that cascading is applied to **individual properties** and not entire rules. This is especially important for
shorthand properties.

### Shorthand properties
A shorthand property allows you to define values for multiple properties at once. Common examples are:
`background`, `margin`, `border`, `padding`...

E.g. setting:
{% highlight css %}
border: 1px solid black;
{% endhighlight %}

is equivalent to:

{% highlight css %}
border-width: 1px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: black;
{% endhighlight %}

which also shorthand and is equivalent to:

{% highlight css %}
border-top-width: 1px;
border-right-width: 1px;
border-bottom-width: 1px;
border-left-width: 1px;
border-top-style: solid;
border-right-style: solid;
border-bottom-style: solid;
border-left-style: solid;
border-top-color: black;
border-right-color: black;
border-bottom-color: black;
border-left-color: black;
{% endhighlight %}

Lets say that I want to create a page like this:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - page with rockets](/articles/css/sample-page-7.png)

All I need is a simple HTML page with two `div`s:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-7a.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

And some CSS to set height and background to them ([rocket icon from simpleicon.com](http://simpleicon.com/rocket.html)):

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-7a.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

Background `background` is shorthand property, which can be seen in browser developer tools,
when you switch to **computed** properties:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot - page with rockets - developer tools](/articles/css/sample-page-7a.png)

So writing down:
{% highlight css %}
background: red url(rocket-64x64.png) repeat-x 50% 50%;
{% endhighlight %}

is equivalent to:

{% highlight css %}
background-color: red;
background-image: url(rocket-64x64.png);
background-repeat-x: repeat;
background-position-x: 50%;
background-position-y: 50%;
background-repeat-y: no-repeat;
{% endhighlight %}

You can take advantage of this (and the fact that you can assign more classes to a
HTML element) and simplify the CSS code to:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-7b.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-7b.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

However if I set the background color for the `rockets` class as well:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-7c.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

It still works well, but this one would not:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-7d.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

When I set the `background-color` for `rockets` class as well, the Cascade kicks in. Notice that
in the above examples it wasn't used at all. There were no conflicts -- although I was setting
background in multiple places, a single background property was never set twice. By setting
`background-color` for the `rockets` class this changed. Now the first example works and the
second one does not. This is by the the [*order of appearance* rule](#cascading) -- i.e. the last definition
of background-color wins, because the selectors `.rockets` and `.red` are otherwise equivalent.
This one does work however:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-7e.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now `red` and `blue` win, because the selector `div.red` has greater specificity
than the simple class selector `.rockets`. Take some time to experiment with different selectors
and Cascade rules.

### Working with the Cascade
The principles on which the CSS Cascade is built encourage you to use **top-down** and
**general-specific** approach. This means that you should start defining your styles from **top** HTML
elements -- `body` and other elements which contain larger portions of the page. And gradually
you get down in the HTML tree. In a same manner, you should start with general rules -- *type selectors*
and then continue to more specific *class selectors*.

In practice this means that when you have a table in a page and you want to make that table e.g. 500px wide,
you **don't** go and add `table {width: 500px;}` to your stylesheet. You have to ask first:

- what does a *normal* table look like?
- what other kinds of tables will I use?
- what are the edge cases end exceptions?

Then you should end up with something along the lines:

- `table {width: 50%}`
- `table.wide {width: 100%}`
- `table.userList {width: 500px}`
- `#userListOnLoginPage {width: 430px}`

Setting the general rules first makes it much easier to maintain the styles. This leads to the concept of
**CSS Reset** style. Contrary to popular belief, CSS Reset is not a single universal style to override
all user-agent and default values. It is
a [*baseline* for your own page style](http://cssreset.com/which-css-reset-should-i-use/).

Now try to guess the behavior of following rules:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-8.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-8.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

What would be the font size of the div *outside* of the table and why?

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
The `div` outside of the table would have font-size 12px, because it **inherits** font size from
its parent (`body`). There is no CSS rule applicable to that `div`, therefore no cascading happens.
</div>

What would be the font size of the paragraph *outside* of the table and why?

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
The `p` outside of the table would have font-size 5px, because there is rule
`p { font-size: 5px; }` which sets font size to all paragraphs. It **overrides** the
inherited font size from its parent (`body`).
</div>

What would be font size of the first table cell and why?

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
The `td` inside the second table cell would have font-size 20px, because it no CSS rule
is applied to it, so it **inherits** font size from
its parent (`tr`), which inherits font size from its parent (`table`). To that element the rule
`table { font-size: 20px; }` is applied, which **overrides** the inherited value from its parent (`body`).
</div>

What would be font size of the first paragraph *inside* the table (second cell) and why?

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
The `p` inside the second table cell would have font-size 5px, because the rule `p { font-size: 5px; }`
is applied to it, which overrides the inherited value from its parent (`table`), which **overrides** the
inherited value from its parent (`body`).
</div>

What would be font size of the second paragraph *inside* the table (third cell) and why?

{: .solution}
<div markdown='1'>
The `p` inside the fourth table cell would have font-size 30px, because the rule `td:first-child p { font-size: 30px; }`
is applied to it. This rules overrides the value from rule `p { font-size: 5px; }`, because it has
higher specificity.
</div>

### Selector Combinators
Now that you understand how cascading works, you can have a look at a more complicated example with
selector combinators. With the following CSS style:

{% highlight css %}
{% include /articles/html/style-9.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

... and the following HTML page:

{% highlight html %}
{% include /articles/html/css-sample-9.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

The page will display like this:

Ok, this looks really ugly, but it demonstrates different selector and combinators. There are
three lists in the page, the first and third are un-ordered and the second one is ordered. The
first and third lists also contain a nested ordered list. The third list has class `menu` and
there is also a paragraph at the beginning for comparison with the base style.

The rule `ul, ol { font-size: 20px; }` applies to all lists and their items (because they
inherit the `font-size` property). It does not apply to the paragraph. The
rule `ul li` applies to all un-ordered list items and makes them on grey background. But then
the rule `ul>li` kicks in and *overrides* the background for the `li` items that are
*direct descendants* of `ul` to red. Notice that none of this applies to the
standalone `ol` list which remains with the transparent background (so you can see the user-agent
default white background of body). Also notice, that the
rule `ul li` applies to the nested `ol`, because its `li` items are still descendants
of some `ul` element (though not direct). Then there is the rule `ul.menu` that applies only
to the third list and makes it yellow. Also notice that the rule applies only to the list
itself (not the list items, their background is set by `ul li` rule), so the only yellow part is list itself.

Then there is the rule `ul.menu a:visited` which makes all visited links in the third list cyan colored. The
rule `li#special a:visited` makes the second link in the first list magenta colored because
it is contained in an `li` with id `special`. It has higher specificity (using id instead of class),
therefore it overrides the previous rule. To test the visited and unvisited links,
open an anonymous (private) browser window.
The last rule is `li ~ li` which selects all but the first item in every list (every `li` item that
has a preceeding sibling `li`) and makes them underlined. Notice that the first item
of the nested list is underlined too, because it inherits the underline from the parent `li`.
Also notice that it works for all three top-level lists, because the preceeding `li` must be a sibling.
Therefore the first item in the second list is not underlined, even though it has a preceeding
`li`, but that `li` is not a sibling. Therefore each list is processed independently.

## CSS Colors
CSS uses the [RGB color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) because it is
primarily designed to display on screen (as opposed to e.g.
[CMYK color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model) primarily designed for printing).
The RGB color model uses three components -- **red**, **green** and **blue** and is **additive**.
You can image additive color model as mixing of lights (spotlights). The base color is black (no
light is emitted). When you turn on green light to maximum, you'll (obviously?) obtain
green color. When you turn on red light to maximum as well, you'll obtain yellow color (as a mix of
100% green and 100% red). If you happen to get hands on a red, green and blue reflector, you can try
it yourself, it really works this way.

The important part is that RGB mixes colors using three components which have intensity. The
intensity can be specified either in percents (0% -- 100%) or absolute value (0 -- 255).
There are three basic options how an RGB color value can be written down in CSS:

- using a [predefined name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Color_keywords): `red`,
- using `rgb` function with intensities: `color: rgb(255, 0, 0)`; or with percentages: `color: rgb(100%, 0, 0)`,
- using `rgba` function with **alpha channel** intensities: `color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)`; or with percentages: `color: rgb(100%, 0, 0, 1)`,
- using `hsl` function defining the [HSL (Hue-saturation-lightness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)
representation of RGB model: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`,
- using `hsla` function defining the HSL representation of RGB model with **alpha channel**: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%, 1)`,
- using the [hexadecimal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) of each component: `#FF0000` or
shorthand hexadecimal notation `#F00`

### Alpha channel
The Alpha channel defines **transparency** of color. It is not strictly part of RGB model, because it does
change the color hue. The alpha channel has value 0 -- 1. Value 0 makes the color fully transparent, value 1
makes the color fully opaque (transparency is set to 0). The default value is 1, i.e. if you do not want
transparent color, you can use the `rgb` function or `rgba` function with last value 1.
Also keep in mind, that if you set alpha channel to 0, then the color is fully transparent, therefore it
does not matter what color it is.

### Hexadecimal colors
When representing RGB colors with [hexadecimal values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal),
you need to take care to convert them correctly. You have to convert each component individually,
i.e. the number `#FF0000` represents 100% red, because `FF` in hexadecimal is
[255 in decimal](https://www.google.cz/search?q=0xFF+to+decimal). If you try to convert the
number `#FF0000` to decimal, you'll obtain nonsense -- 16711680.

Hexadecimal values can be shortened to three digits in case the digits in each component are repeated.
That means, you can shorten `#FF0000` to `#F00`. Keep in mind that the shortening is always applies to
each component individually and either to all components or to no components. Therefore `#F0` or `#FF00` would be
invalid. The value `#FF0` represents `#FFFF00` (100% red and 100% green).

### Hue-saturation-lightness
[HSL (Hue-saturation-lightness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) is a different representation
of the RGB model. As the name suggests, it uses three components:

- `hue` -- the color hue value (0 -- 360), represents position over a
['rainbow' of colors](https://www.google.cz/search?q=coor+picker),
- `saturation` -- represents the color intensity (0 -- 100%), 0% is grey, 100% is full color,
- `lightness` -- represents the lightness of color (0 -- 100%), 0% is black, 100% is white.

You can read more about available color values in the
[color documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). To select a color
value use a [color picker](https://www.google.cz/search?q=coor+picker) or
[color scheme picker](http://paletton.com/) to pick multiple matching colors.

## CSS Units
There are [many CSS units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#lengths)) to set sizes of different elements,
most used ones are *px*, *em*, *rem*, *pt* and *%*. The available units fall into categories:

- absolute units -- pixels (`px`), centimeters (`cm`), millimeters (`mm`), [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)) (`pt`), ...
- relative units -- percents (`%`)
    - font-relative units -- [em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)) (`em`), [em of the root element (body)](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#rem) (`rem`), x-height [ex](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#ex) (`ex`), advance height [ch](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#ch) (`ch`) ...
- viewport-relative units -- viewport width percent (`vw`), viewport height percent (`vh`), the larger of `vw` or `vh` (`vmax`), the smaller of `vw` or `vh` (`vmin`) ...

Absolute units have exactly [defined physical values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths),
including the pixel (which has a rather [complicated definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel)).
But beware that inches and centimeters are
actually [converted to pixels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length#CSS_units_and_dots-per-inch).
It is generally better to use font-relative units for good page design. This is because the end-user might want to
use bigger font to improve page readability. Using relative units makes the rest of the page accommodate to that.

You may also encounter unit-less values. A typical example would be `margin: 0`, it is perfectly valid to write
this because it makes no difference where it is zero points or zero pixels. Another example is e.g. the
`line-height` property which can be specified as multiplier. I.e. `line-height: 1.2` means 1.2 &times; bigger
then the base line height defined by the font. You can read more about various units in the
[documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units).

{: .note}
Do you remember [CSS Box Model](/articles/css/layout/#css-box-model)? Think of it a bit. You cannot simply use
different CSS units for border/padding/margin and width/height if you want to achieve **precise** size of an element.
Thankfully there is the [`calc()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) function in CSS which you can
use to determine correct size of element. E.g. if you want to have five 20% wide elements with 5px border you can set
CSS like this:

{% highlight css %}
div.box {
  width: calc(20% - 10px);
  float: left;
  height: 50px;
  border: 5px solid red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<div class="box">1</div>
<div class="box">2</div>
<div class="box">3</div>
<div class="box">4</div>
<div class="box">5</div>
{% endhighlight %}

{: .note.note-cont}
This makes each `div` element 20% wide **including** its border.

## At rules
At rules are part of CSS syntax I omitted [at the beginning](#css-syntax). At rules are special kind of rules which do not
immediately define a style for some HTML elements. Some common at rules are:

- [`@charset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@charset) -- used to specify the
[character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) e.g. `@charset "UTF-8";`, important when using the
[`content` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content).
- [`@media`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) -- allows to defined **nested rules** for different media types (`screen`, `print`, `speech`). This is very useful to
create styles for pages that print nicely -- e.g. `@media print { body { font-size: 10pt } }`.
- [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) -- Allows you to define a font, which is not installed on the end-user computer. The font will be downloaded
with the web page.
- [`@import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import) -- Allows importing other CSS file. This can be
used to organize he CSS code better -- e.g. `@import url("colors.css")`.

## Summary
In this article I tried to describe the syntax and some important concepts of Cascading style sheets (CSS)
langauge.
There are also other languages for defining CSS rules -- e.g. [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) or
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) which aim to simplify the stylesheets. All of these languages however always
have to be transformed into CSS, as that is the only language which web browsers understand.

Although the syntax of the CSS language is pretty simple, the rules which are used when actually
drawing HTML elements on screen are very complex. That means that creating a full page layout and design
from scratch is non-trivial task and requires a lot of experience and deep understanding of CSS.
It is also a very creative process, meaning that two different people will usually come up with two
different solutions of page layout (HTML and CSS structure) which can render similar results in a browser.
Fortunately there is an immense amount of ready to use (and free) templates with various complexity and
support for customization, e.g.:

- Bootstrap ([getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/)),
- Free CSS Layouts ([maxdesign.com.au](http://maxdesign.com.au/css-layouts/)),
- Foundation ([foundation.zurb.com](http://foundation.zurb.com/)),
- Skeleton ([getskeleton.com](http://getskeleton.com/)),
- SemanticUI ([semantic-ui.com](http://semantic-ui.com/)).

acquainted with Bootstrap framework.
